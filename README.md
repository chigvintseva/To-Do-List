# TO-DO List Application

## Description

This project is a simple TO-DO list application designed as one of my first steps in learning and practicing JavaScript, along with front-end development and HTML. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. The current design is basic, and I plan to enhance its functionality and appearance in the future.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task to the list by entering it into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Users can mark a task as completed by clicking the green checkmark button.
- **Remove Task**: Users can remove a task by clicking the red cross button.
- **Task Status Indicator**: Each task displays an icon indicating its status (incomplete, completed).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the interactive functionality of the TO-DO list.

## Problem Solved

The TO-DO list application addresses the common need for a simple and effective way to keep track of tasks. It provides a basic interface for users to manage their tasks, helping them stay organized and focused.

## Motivation

This project is based on the Duke University course on Coursera. It serves as a practical exercise to apply the concepts learned in the course and to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript and front-end development.

## What I Learn

- **JavaScript Basics**: Understanding how to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and manage state.
- **HTML and CSS**: Learning how to structure and style a web page effectively.
- **User Interaction**: Creating a user-friendly interface that responds to user actions.
- **Project Structuring**: Organizing code and resources in a coherent and maintainable manner.

## Future Planned Enhancements

- **Display Completed Tasks**: Add functionality to display a list of completed tasks when a button is clicked.
- **Design Adjustments**: Improve the visual design of the application for a better user experience.
